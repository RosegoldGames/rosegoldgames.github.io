                    The Otherworld takes place in a fantasy medieval setting, in a world that is made up of large chunks of land
                    floating in the sky. There are different regions of land, each looking very unique and out-of-place from the other.
                    It is as if the Otherworld wasn’t supposed to exist naturally. Each land has its own types of stone, foliage,
                    trees, and even sky.

                    Different types of people occupy each region. They live in the borders of their lands, each race of people having
                    their own unique culture, and living a completely different lifestyle. Some have plentiful resources and are
                    advancing in technology. Others prefer to be one with their nature, living off their land.

                    diplomatic, while others take a more aggressive stance to outsiders.

                        The Mainlands is a vast grassy meadow, home to the Human race. It holds cities made of brick and copper, with some
                        houses even utilizing the recent discovery of electrical lighting. Main resources include copper and silver, which
                        are used for currency and everyday life. Humans are very diplomatic and try to maintain peace and connections,
                        while advancing quickly in technology and discovery.

                        The Deepwoods is a coniferous redwood taiga, home to the Oni race. They are much like humans, but are larger and
                        stronger. They also have pointed ears and horns growing from their heads. They live together in campsites; common
                        homes are teepees, with campfires to stay warm from the cold nights. The Deepwoods is full of valuable resources
                        like iron and plentiful yet dangerous animals. The Oni do not welcome outsiders warmly, especially those who
                        practice magic. They keep the peace with humans, however.

                        Faiechantia is a magical and ancient forest, home to the Fairie race. The Fairies are naturally in tune with magic
                        and hold many tales and secrets of the world. They live within the ancient trees themselves, with boardwalks
                        connecting their treetop houses. Valuable resources include Opal, a sturdy gemstone with magical powers used for
                        crafting weapons and tools. Fairies mostly keep to themselves to protect their ancient ways. They only open up to
                        those who are in tune with magic themselves and respect their ways.

                        Rosquartzia is another magical land, made of rose-quartz crystal fields. It is home to the Roseian race, who are
                        natural-born users of healing magic. They live in small villages and are known to be calm, friendly, protective,
                        and sensitive to emotions. They are direct allies with the Fairies and rely on the Fairies’ strength and fighting
                        knowledge to survive an ongoing conflict with the Oni. In return, the Roseians heal Fairies from wounds and any
                        kind of ailments. Common resources are Rosegold for coins, tools, and daily life, and Rose-Quartz for building
                        materials.

                        Glaceia is a freezing land full of snow and ice, home to the Iceian race. The Iceians look as if they were sculpted
                        from blue ice, their skin glossy and frozen. They are stubborn, strong, and logical, and interactions can be cold.
                        However, they have a warm side. They strongly focus on caring for family and are very loyal to friends. Due to
                        their extreme environment, Iceians are most comfortable being frozen and despise the heat. They rarely venture
                        beyond Glaceia’s boundaries due to the climate of the other regions. On the rare occasions they do, they utilize
                        Sapphire, a common valuable resource, to craft armor. This protects them from heat and outside elements. Iceians
                        live in close settlements, varying from igloos to buildings sculpted from dense ice.

                        Elaria is a temperate and lush swampy jungle, full of vines and poisonous plants. It is home to the Elarian race,
                        green sentient plant people with vines for hair. They live in a sheltered tribal setting, utilizing natural poisons
                        to protect their lands from outsiders with ill intentions. They live in primal tribes, crafting weapons and tools
                        made of Jade.

                        Emberia is a glowing-hot lava-filled world, home to the Emberian race. They are the polar opposite of Iceians, with
                        skin made of ash and hair glowing with fire. Emberians are most comfortable in the sweltering heat, and the hotter
                        it is, the more energy they have. Emberians are the second most advanced race besides humans. They live in compact
                        cities under a militant empire, with fire-immune buildings made of compacted ash and other igneous rocks. Topaz is
                        a very common resource in this region, and the Emberians utilize it for coins, weapons, and tools. Topaz emits heat
                        naturally, so armor is made of it to keep Emberians burning, even in cold environments. Emberians have an ongoing
                        conflict with Iceians due to their elemental nature and conflicting cultures.

                        poisonous weapons, Topaz for heat and armor if the player is Emberian and for burning weapons, Sapphire for cold
                        and armor if an Iceian player and for weapons that freeze and stun enemies. Roseians can provide healing antidotes.

                        these “locked” regions, but death will be almost certain if the player is not prepared, and the cost is that they
                        will lose their gathered items and their progress.
